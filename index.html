        My name is Kevin O'Brien and I am excited to show you my stuff.  
        While I have been developing small applications for several years, none of my experience includes web-based technologies.  
        Before now, that is.  ENTER: Coding Boot Camp.
        <br>
        <br>
        While many in Coding Boot Camp are changing careers and looking for new employment opportunities, I am in a different situation.  
        My employer is paying for my full stack development training.  Of course nothing is for free.  In return for receiving partial
        tuition reimbursement, I have agreed to continue my employment for three years.  This is a small price to pay since I am happily employed.<!DOCTYPE html>
        <br>
        <br>
        My next role with my current employer will likely make use of the skills I am learning.  In addition, I am always open to freelance work to keep my skills sharp.
